# Rezi-Plugins

This is the plugins github for [Rezi](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi)! Here you can view plugins made by users and myself. 

If you want to contribute and add your own plugins, please create an issue for it to be verified. You may submit the code in any way you like as long as it allows me to download it and get it onto this github.

Plugins can do a range of things such as add more consoles, or add seperate sources instead of what normally ships with the bot. Just make an issue and see what happens! 

If you want a quicker response, submit it in my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/47SnjxgBFb) as well, and I will be more likely to see it earlier.
